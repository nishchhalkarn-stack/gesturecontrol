Create a real-time interactive 3D particle system in Three.js. The system should use the camera to track hand gestures and dynamically control particle behavior-including expansion, color changes, and switching between particle templates such as hearts, flowers, Saturn shapes, fireworks, and more.
Final control scheme:
Fist: Shape Change (Toggle next shape)
Pinch (Index + Thumb): Expand/Contract
Index Finger Pointing (Left/Right): Color Hue Shift
